# My-first-BP-network
---
This project is my first try on BP-network，a exploration on the initialization of BP，and it is finished on 2017/4/29. 

If you have interest in DeepLearning，you can try this project as your Knocking brick because you can learn well about the parameters in network such as,learning rate, initial ways for parameters，SGD , local optimum and so on. 

The result is in my project report,and my experiment data is updated here.

If you have some question,contact me.
